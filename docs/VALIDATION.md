# Validation

Target: Arduino Mega 2560, eight-slot capacity. Parallel-backend validation was
performed on 2026-09-22. No firmware upload or physical multi-PSU test was performed.

```sh
python3 tools/test_host.py
PLATFORMIO_CORE_DIR=/home/dave/psu-can-workspace/.platformio pio run \
  -e mega2560 -e mega2560_serial -e mega2560_display \
  -e mega2560_local -e mega2560_minimal -j 4
git diff --check
```

The absolute cache path isolates this workspace's PlatformIO packages; elsewhere
omit it or choose another writable cache. All five profiles build successfully
with the pinned Atmel AVR platform 5.3.0, Arduino AVR framework 5.4.0, AVR GCC
7.3.0, CAN 0.3.1, SSD1306Ascii 1.3.5, ClickEncoder d6d5738fdf, and TimerOne 1.2.0.
A clean build retains ClickEncoder's existing constructor member-order warnings.

| Profile | Static RAM (bytes / 8192) | Flash (bytes / 253952) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `mega2560` | 3601 | 53944 |
| `mega2560_serial` | 3307 | 47218 |
| `mega2560_display` | 3576 | 52490 |
| `mega2560_local` | 2891 | 27448 |
| `mega2560_minimal` | 2559 | 19536 |

Static RAM excludes worst-case stack/interrupt nesting. EEPROM reserves only
512 bytes, with two 256-byte slots and a 216-byte schema-2 record at this capacity.

## Host coverage

The tests compile production configuration, protocol, discovery, controller,
EEPROM, serial parser, and MCP2515 transmit code with simulated hardware/time.
Compiler flags include `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` and AddressSanitizer/
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. LeakSanitizer is disabled for the ptrace sandbox;
address and undefined-behaviour checks remain enabled.

The suite passes. Its assertion total is dominated by checking every EEPROM
access and interruption boundary, not hundreds of thousands of independent cases.
Meaningful scenarios include:

- Exact telemetry/INFO/setting IDs and payloads; malformed frames; rated-current
  conversion, signed temperatures, efficiency, available current, and Ah.
- Identity corroboration, invalid identity, collisions, stale addresses,
  address relocation, unbound devices, registry capacity, and ready/not-ready.
- Disjoint group membership, equal shares and rounding, configured capacity
  rejection without clamping, and staged-versus-authorized voltage/current.
- Two- and eight-unit applies; global voltage before current; explicit offline
  defaults; per-write identity probe timeout and replacement detection.
- Wrong register/address/value ACKs, rejection, transport failure, timeout,
  partial physical success, loss between voltage ACKs and current phase, recovery
  after a loss during an apply, and retained error states across other group jobs.
- Missing-member block without writes; explicit partial confirmation; original
  shares; confirmation expiry and config/topology changes; unoverrideable faults.
- Known-identity recovery to a different address using authorized settings,
  never later drafts; boot auto-resume off/on; load-only staging; wrong deployment;
  membership changes never triggering automatic redistribution; rebinding and
  saving never granting the replacement the old unit's boot authorization.
- Independent identity/data scheduling at long poll intervals; wrap-safe
  freshness; no repeated fault-clearing writes while readiness remains unchanged.
- Every EEPROM update interruption on initial and third save, and first schema-2
  migration save; fallback from corrupted latest record; readback failure;
  wrong deployment; invalid config; too-small storage; all accesses within 512 bytes.
- All eight groups/identities/ratings, draft and operating values round-trip;
  uniform legacy migration with identity/auto-resume disabled; mixed legacy
  preservation and inspection without silent rewriting.
- Serial group commissioning and commands; decoded diagnostics; malformed
  numbers; capacity explanations; partial-apply warning, confirmation and Ctrl-X
  cancellation; current/OVP ACKs and final E-Label fragment.
- Character echo/backspace/DEL, CRLF split across ticks, tabs, overflow draining,
  reconnect without output observation, idle timeout before consuming new bytes,
  timeout rollover, raw-output prompt redraw, and active jobs surviving console reset.
- MCP2515 success/arbitration/errors/abort/no completion/stuck TXREQ, bounded
  timeout, rollover, preserved RX flags, and invalid frame rejection.

## Physical bench checks still required

Use [the serial commissioning guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) for the actual command
sequence. Run initial communication checks without a battery/load; introduce
power tests only after commissioning appropriate limits and defaults.

1. Boot without USB, reconnect, and exercise the [serial lifecycle checks](SERIAL.md).
   Verify input works with CAN disconnected and with optional display absent.
   Check CS/INT/SPI, module crystal and termination if transmit errors rise.
2. With every intended PSU powered, inspect `diag bus`, `diag group NAME` and
   `raw on` briefly. Verify distinct stable identities, data replies, unsolicited
   broadcasts, correct ready-byte interpretation and no growing receive drops.
3. Label physical units and source groups. Confirm identity mapping individually,
   then repeat different power-up orders and address changes. A known identity
   must stay bound to its intended slot/group; an unknown replacement must not
   receive a setting before explicit adoption.
4. Apply modest selected limits and check ACKs plus a meter/load. Validate current
   scaling and actual source-group loading under parallel operation. A successful
   command or telemetry frame alone does not prove electrical behaviour.
5. Remove CAN from a member during preview, identity guard, and setting ACK wait.
   Inspect blocking/results, existing outputs, and the explicit partial workflow.
   Restore it at a changed address; verify the authorized profile returns without
   applying subsequently saved drafts or redistributing peers' current.
6. Test a not-ready unit and a rejecting unit. Check bounded attempts and clear
   errors, then recovery after a genuine readiness transition. Check that a
   partly failed global voltage apply prevents group-current changes until fixed.
7. Save profiles with auto-resume off/on, reboot with all/missing/replacement units,
   and observe actual write traffic. Test wrong deployment ID and legacy review
   before relying on stored profiles. Do not overwrite the only legacy copy
   before exporting it if it must be retained.
8. Set PSU offline defaults explicitly. Test controller/CAN loss and PSU power
   cycling, including the interval before discovery can verify a returning unit.
   Confirm hardware fallback is compatible with the common parallel bus.
9. Observe RX drops with all units, raw/watch output, EEPROM save, and optional
   display/wheel activity. Simulated tests do not validate real arbitration,
   UART/USB buffering, I2C faults, interrupt latency or worst-case loop load.
10. Where required, test EEPROM power interruption under the board's actual
    brownout configuration. The software journal tests do not model analogue
    brownout corruption or provide an electrical interlock.
